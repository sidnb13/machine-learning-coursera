# Non-linear hypotheses

* Computer vision - section matrix of pixel intensities correspond to an image
  * Denote + and â€“ for affirming if an image fits a classification
  * Would need nonlinear hypothesis
  * Feature vector $x$ - pixel intensities in a column vector
* Example
  * Assume $50\times 50$ pixel images - 2500 pixels
    * $n=2500$ features
  * Quadratic features would mean ~ 3 mil features
    * $\text{number of features}=50^2 + C(50^2,2)$ as need all possible ways of 2 terms from features in addition to number of features present

# Neural Networks

* Mimic brain
* Neural rewiring - parts of brain learn other tasks
